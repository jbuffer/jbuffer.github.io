  Hi again

So, a bit more about myself. I work as a Data Scientist 👩‍💻 interested in NLP, and I am currently studying at the University of London. 

I have a penchant for 🍕, and I enjoy taking smudgy blurred photographs of anything I can persuade to stay still, with secret deluded ambitions of Man Ray greatness. 

I run quite far and reasonably often, and live my best life heckling / crying at a game of ⚽ - Champions League or Sunday League, I don't discriminate.

I also have a dog. A very cute dog. She's small, she can fit my foot in her mouth, and she likes to bark at gnomes.
