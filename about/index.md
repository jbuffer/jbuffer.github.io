  Hi again

So, a bit more about myself. I work as a Data Scientist, and I am currently studying at the University of London. I have a particular interest in NLP, and often enjoy a bit of cartography on a wet and miserable Thursday evening. I run quite far and reasonably often, and like heckling / crying at a game of kickball âš½.

I also have a dog. A very cute dog. She's small, she can fit my foot in her mouth, and she likes to barks at gnomes.
