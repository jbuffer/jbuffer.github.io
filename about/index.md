# Hi again, I'm Jen ðŸ‘‹

So, a bit more about myself. I work as a Data Scientist, and I am currently studying at the University of London. I have a particular interest in NLP, and often enjoy a bit of cartography on a wet and miserable Thursday evening.

I also have a dog. A very cute dog. She's small, she can fit my foot in her mouth, and she likes to barks at gnomes.
